Installation
=============================================================================

1) Install Python 3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2) Use pip to install hdhr_disk_space_monitor from the internet:

     pip install hdhr_disk_space_monitor

   Or, if you've downloaded a source distribution:

     pip install hdhr_disk_space_monitor-2.0.0.zip

   Either of those will result in an executable script being installed in
   your PATH which can invoke hdhr_disk_space_monitor.

3) Verify installation with a couple of commands:

     hdhr_disk_space_monitor --version
     hdhr_disk_space_monitor --help


Set-up and Configuration
=============================================================================

A sample configuration file and systemd service file will be installed. Look
for them in locations such as the following, or grab them from GitHub
(https://github.com/jmattroberts/hdhr-disk-space-monitor):

  Linux/BSD:
    /usr/share/hdhr_disk_space_monitor
    /usr/local/share/hdhr_disk_space_monitor
    $HOME/.local/share/hdhr_disk_space_monitor

  Windows:
    %ProgramFiles%\Python 3.8\share\hdhr_disk_space_monitor
    %ProgramFiles(x86)%\Python 3.8\share\hdhr_disk_space_monitor
    %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Python\Python38\share\hdhr_disk_space_monitor
    %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Python\Python38-32\share\hdhr_disk_space_monitor
    %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Python\Python38-64\share\hdhr_disk_space_monitor
    %APPDATA%\Python\share\hdhr_disk_space_monitor

The systemd service file can be copied to /etc/systemd/system and modified as
required. It is recommended that a dedicated, non-privileged user be created
and the systemd service file be modified to specify that user. To start the
service and ensure that it starts on reboot, run the following:

  # systemctl enable hdhr_disk_space_monitor
  # systemctl start hdhr_disk_space_monitor

The example configuration file can be copied to any desired location and
edited as required. Invoke the monitor with the -f/--conf-file argument to
have the configuration file settings applied. E.g.:

  hdhr_disk_space_monitor -f /etc/hdhr_disk_space_monitor.conf
